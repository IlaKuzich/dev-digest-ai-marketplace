# PreToolUse(Bash) gate for the pr-self-review skill.
#
# Blocks `git push` / `gh pr create` unless a FRESH pr-self-review with ZERO blockers
# exists for the current open changes. Reads the verdict artifact the skill wrote
# ($CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/.pr-self-review-state.json) and recomputes the diff
# fingerprint via pr-review-diff-hash.sh so a stale review can't slip through.
#
# Contract: exit 0 = allow; exit 2 = deny (stderr shown to the agent).
# Any command that is not a push/PR-create is allowed untouched.
#
# Session-wide hook (not agent-scoped): wired via this plugin's hooks/hooks.json using
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}, so it fires regardless of which agent/skill is running when the
# push happens — the gate has to catch a push from ANY context, not just from run-plan.
